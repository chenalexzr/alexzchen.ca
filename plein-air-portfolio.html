      <h1>Plein Air Painting</h1>
      <p>
        For this school project I was tasked with observing and capturing my surroundings and relaying 
        it back onto the canvas within a plein-air portfolio scenario. I used this opportunity to 
        experiment with texture, matte painting, colour palettes, and composition. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our first objective within this class was to identify our strengths and
        weaknesses trying to break away from what we were familiar with.</p>

    <p>For the first prompt, I wanted to work on my shape language and colour palette.
        Alongside the photos and sketches taken from my walk, I also compiled
        supplementary images of deserts and canyons to help me with my ideas.</p>

    <p>After a few rounds of paint overs and discussion we decided to settle on the following character; the Curious Time Traveler.</p>

      <img src="images/plein-air/alex-chen-plein-air-portfolio-digital-illustration-slide-4.jpg" alt="drawing studies and experimentation of a rocky wasteland">
      <p>The first painting is a combination of a desert, canyon, and foliage put together.
        Using the ideas of the cracks within potholes and the gaping chasms of canyons
        I wanted to show a sense of desolation and profoundness within this composition. </p>

      <p>The second walk was taken from my local neighbourhood, paying close attention to the different ways 
        people have decorated their own homes. The houses that I passed by on my walk held many intricate 
        shapes within its architecture which allowed me to formulate the next idea for my painting. </p>
      <img src="images/plein-air/alex-chen-plein-air-portfolio-digital-illustration-slide-6.jpg" alt="moodboard of houses and their front yards">
      <img src="images/plein-air/alex-chen-plein-air-portfolio-digital-illustration-slide-7.jpg" alt="sketches of neighbourhoods and houses.">
      <img src="images/plein-air/alex-chen-plein-air-portfolio-digital-illustration-slide-8.jpg" alt="refined composition sketch of a house with a curved roof">
      <p>Using a combination of the different houses I witnessed and the shapes within their architecture,
        I created my second painting based on my neighbourhood surroundings. </p>

      <p>Finally for my third walk I visited a local flower shop that I would often pass by whenever I went to attend errands. 
          I took this chance to explore the shop in more detail and used the setting for my third painting.</p>

      <img src="images/plein-air/alex-chen-plein-air-portfolio-digital-illustration-slide-11.jpg" alt="composition thumbnails of a flower shop">
      <p>During my observations I noticed that light would always pool into the store during different times of the day 
          at a specific angle. I decided to relay this into my painting to show a sense of whimsical discovery.
    </p>
